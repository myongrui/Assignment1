Personal Portfolio Website
    This website is created as a website that presents myself to employers. It consist of 4 pages, hompage, about, education and contact. The about basically describes myself, it includes a brief intro, my hobbies and lifestyle. The education page shows my knowledge acquired through education, projects 
    I made, any work experience and competitions I have been a part of. I made this website with HTML, CSS and JS. I had to do a bit of research to make the website I had in mind, mostly when using JS. 
Design Process
    This website is for employers that want to employ me as a back-end of front-end developer. The website has to introduce me, so that they know some information about me. It also has to present to them all the relevant knowledge that I have which would indicate my capabilities as a programmer. 
    There is a wireframe for the website and it is included in the folder. I wanted to make the theme of the website be a program so it has method calling as the navigation bar i.e. the about page is .about(). I also put html semantics for paragraphs which enriches the theme of a program i.e. <div> at the start of a paragraph and </div> at the ned of a paragraph. The background color matches the color of vsc background and the accent colors are colors you get from typing in code. 
Features
    Some notifiable features are:
    education page is a timeline which is scrollable and has animation to bring in the text from the sides. 
    contact page has validation for the form which is done using js
    about page topbar heading changes when reaching different sections
    Features left to implement:
    adding better animation and sound when clicking on certain buttons
Testing
    1.Contact:
        i.Go to .contact() page
        ii. try to submit an invalid email and notification will pop up
        iii. try to submit the form all valid inputs and a successful message appears
        iv. try to submit the form with any empty fields will return a error message
    On smaller screens, the about page moves the videos and images below the text. The contact page navigation bar is also moved to the center.
